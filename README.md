# Snowman Project

## Progression through the project
First, I created a wireframe of the most essential parts of the game. This included a display of the letters, snowman image, reset game, and empty boxes where the correct letters would be filled. 

In the HTML I created the basic skeleton for the webpage, such as the buttons with the letters on them. Then in my JavaScript file, I created all of the global variables such as 'listofWords', 'randomWord', 'correctGuesses' and 'incorrectGuesses' because I knew these variables would be in multiple functions. 

I knew that I wanted to create the largest functions early on. For this reason, I created the 'generateWord' fuction, 'reset' function, and click function that deciphers between if the user chose the correct and incorrect letter. 


### First Roadblock
My first roadblock was that I should not have created the high-level functions first. By creating them first, I found myself pausing to go create helper functions for the main fuctions. Rather I should have created all of the lower-lever (helper) functions first, and then gone back and created the higher-level functions. 

Lastly, I created the win and lose functions. For these functions, I created a correctLetters array and an incorrectLetters array. If the length of the correctLetters array was equal to the randomWord selected, then the user won. If the incorrectLetters array was greater than 7 then the player lost. 

### Second Roadblock 
After completing most of the JS, I began the CSS. I created eight images of a snowman falling apart on Canva. I then imported these images, and I needed the snowman to fall apart as the user guessed incorrect letters. I had trouble figuring out a way for the images to match each incorrect guess.
