# Snowman Project

## Steps to complete the project

First, I created a wireframe of the most essential parts of the game. This included a display of the letters, snowman image, reset game, and empty boxes where the correct letters would be filled. 

In the HTML In the JavaScript file, I first created all of the global variables such as 'listofWords', 'randomWord', 'correctGuesses' and 'incorrectGuesses' because I knew these variables would be in multiple functions.
